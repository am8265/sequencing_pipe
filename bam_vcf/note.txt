There is bam_thing program required in the sequencing pipeline. 
bam_thing program is genereated from /nfs/seqscratch_ssd/dsth/vcf_thing/bam_eof_make_more_stringent_for_constant_checks.cpp
But bam_thing caused segementation fault on the bam files generated from dragen4 machine. 
I did a small hack to the source code /nfs/seqscratch_ssd/dsth/vcf_thing/bam_eof_make_more_stringent_for_constant_checks.cpp to avoid the segementation fault issue. (bam_check_hack.cpp) 
bam_thing_old: generated from bam_eof_make_more_stringent_for_constant_checks.cpp
bam_thing: compiled from bam_check_hack.cpp

bam_thing program is currently placed at /nfs/seqscratch_ssd/dsth/vcf_thing/bam_thing in production.
